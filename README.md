# hello-world

bankole tosin by name,
i just love being me 
i hope to be a great programmer
i hope i learn coding fast
i am learning fast 
but not too understanding as i ought to
yes i am still trying my best to understand this stuff
but till date i am yet to understand what i am doing
but thank God i have someone who is not giving up on me 
i will keep learning everyday
little drop makes a mighty ocean
thank you for all you do
i was able to push my text from vs code to github website and i think that has been a step ahead for me
let me also try and push this write up as well
